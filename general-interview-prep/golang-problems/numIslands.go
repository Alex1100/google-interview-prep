/*
  Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water),
  count the number of islands.
  An island is surrounded by water and is formed by
  connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
  You may assume all four edges of the grid are
  all surrounded by water.

  Example 1:

  Input:
  [
    [11110],
    [11010],
    [11000],
    [00000],
  ]

  Output: 1

  Example 2:

  Input:
  [
    [11000],
    [11000],
    [00100],
    [00011],
  ]

  Output: 3
