use the STAR method

The STAR method is a structured manner of responding
to a behavioral-based interview question by discussing
the specific situation, task, action, and result of the
situation you are describing.

Situation:
  Describe the situation that you were in or the task
  that you needed to accomplish. Be specific.
  Situation could be from previous job, volunteering,
  or any relevant experience.

Task:
  What goal were you working toward?

Action:
  Describe the actions you took to address the situation with
  an appropriate amount of detail and keep the focus on YOU.
  What specific steps did you take and what was your
  contribution? Be careful that you don't describe what the
  team or group did when talking about a project, but what you actually did.
  Use the word "I", not "we" when describing actions.

Result:
  Describe the outcome of your actions and don't be shy about
  taking credit for your behavior.

  What happened?
  How did the event end?
  What did you accomplish?
  What did you learn?

  Make sure your answer contains a combination of these, if not all


SAMPLE STAR RESPONSE:

Situation (S):
  Advertising revenue was falling off for my college newspaper, The Review, and
  large numbers of long-term advertisers were not renewing contracts.

Task (T):
  My goal was to generate new ideas, materials and incentives that would result in at
  least a 15% increase in advertisers from the year before.

Action (A):
  I designed a new promotional packet to go with the rate sheet and compared the
  benefits of The Review circulation with other ad media in the area. I also set-up a special training
  session for the account executives with a School of Business Administration professor who
  discussed competitive selling strategies.

Result (R):
  We signed contracts with 15 former advertisers for daily ads and five for special
  supplements. We increased our new advertisers by 20 percent over the same period last year.



TIPS FOR PREPARING:

• Recall recent situations that show favorable behaviors or actions, especially involving course
  work, work experience, leadership, teamwork, initiative, planning, and customer service.

• Prepare short descriptions of each situation; be ready to give details if asked.

• Be sure each story has a beginning, middle, and an end, i.e., be ready to describe the situation,
  including the task at hand, your action, and the outcome or result.

• Be sure the outcome or result reflects positively on you (even if the result itself was not
  favorable).

• Be honest. Don't embellish or omit any part of the story. The interviewer will find out if your
  story is built on a weak foundation.

• Be specific. Don't generalize about several events; give a detailed accounting of one event.

• Vary your examples; don’t take them all from just one area of your life.
