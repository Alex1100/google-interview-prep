1. A time when you faced a problem that had multiple solutions

I had to develop a feature for Listing Loop's website, where the home page had to include a map of
Australia as the background/backdrop. We could have used a map such as open maps or google maps,
and eventually I went with Open Maps. I was trying to find a way to make sure the map content
didn't interfere with the overall performance of the website. The feature initially had us draw a bounding box around all
of the cities which a potential buyer or agent had marked that they were interested in exploring.
I had realized if I had just an image of the map, instead of the map itself which would be
dynamically changed/loaded by JavaScript each time
a new city had been included in the list of cities, then we would reduce the overall cost of performance.
So, I addressed these concerns with our UI/UX lead and designer and we had come to an agreement
that a static image would serve us and our customers better.
Once our customers began using the product, they had no complaints as to the performance of the site.



2. When did you take a risk, make a mistake or fail? How did you respond?

I had assured our customer, Indiana University, that my team and I would be able to complete all deliverables by a certain date.
I was unable to motivate my team as the senior software engineering manager. I made a mistake in not speaking up the real concerns
of my team. I had known that the team did not have enough time to complete the deliverables and I was
lying to the customer, so I wouldn't need to face the harsh truth that I had failed them as a leader.
Due to my failure, I had given my senior developer at the time a false sense of security.
I learned that when I speak with customers, it is always in there best interest to be honest
about current circumstances. I had let the customer known eventually that I would need more time to complete the deliverables,
surprisingly, they understood and I had been able to secure more time for my team to complete their tasks.


3. What did you do when you needed to motivate a group of individuals?

I had walked into the office at The Action Network on a early Monday morning
and I realized everyone in the office was out of it. Everyone was very groggy, tired and unmotivated.
I needed to collaborate with a few team mates to review some code and push out new changes, so I
offered the office (group of 5 - 6 employees) a round of coffee on me.
After I brought the office some coffee, 20 minutes later we were firing on all pistons and I was able to
get my code reviewed and merged.


4. How have you leveraged data to develop a strategy?

I had began gaining interest in the crypto space prior to the ICO bubble of 2017
and I realized how with the right data, there was some serious money to be made.
So, I had decided to build my own Cryptocurrency Trading Bot.
I had spent months building out the perfect automated trading system. My bot would execute trades anytime
there was an arbitrage between multiple exchanges. I would have an open feed of web-socket data being piped into my
trading bot and depending on the location of the arbitrage and the amount, I would have the trading bot execute
a trade.


5. A time when a team member didn't meet your expectations on a project

I was given the task to add Redux-Sagas to our client side React application, and I had already confirmed with
the team that this would not introduce any technical debt. However, after including Redux-Sagas into our codebase,
one of my teammates had addressed concern and brought up the fact that they did not know this technology.
I was then responsible for helping my teammate ramp up. I spent a couple of hours on the phone with this teammate
and explained everything to the best of my ability. After a week, this individual had left the team and moved onto
another company.


6. Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned from it

I had assured our customer, Indiana University, that my team and I would be able to complete all deliverables by a certain date.
I was unable to motivate my team as the senior software engineering manager. I made a mistake in not speaking up the real concerns
of my team. I had known that the team did not have enough time to complete the deliverables and I was
lying to the customer, so I wouldn't need to face the harsh truth that I had failed them as a leader.
Due to my failure, I had given my senior developer at the time a false sense of security.
I learned that when I speak with customers, it is always in there best interest to be honest
about current circumstances. I had let the customer known eventually that I would need more time to complete the deliverables,
surprisingly, they understood and I had been able to secure more time for my team to complete their tasks.
